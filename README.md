## About

Contao is a powerful open source CMS that allows you to create professional
websites and scalable web applications. Visit the [project website][1] for more
information.

## Purpose

The purpose of this package is to develop the Contao bundles. Use it if you
e.g. want to create a pull request or if you want to report an issue.

The monorepo is split into separate packages automatically:

 * [CalendarBundle](https://github.com/contao/calendar-bundle)
 * [CommentsBundle](https://github.com/contao/comments-bundle)
 * [CoreBundle](https://github.com/contao/core-bundle)
 * [FaqBundle](https://github.com/contao/faq-bundle)
 * [InstallationBundle](https://github.com/contao/installation-bundle)
 * [ListingBundle](https://github.com/contao/listing-bundle)
 * [ManagerBundle](https://github.com/contao/manager-bundle)
 * [NewsBundle](https://github.com/contao/news-bundle)
 * [NewsletterBundle](https://github.com/contao/newsletter-bundle)

**Please do not use `contao/contao` in production**! Use the split packages
instead.

## Development

To create a pull request and to test your changes within a running Contao
application, it is the easiest to use the [Contao Managed Edition][2]. Start by
installing it in your current directory:

```bash
composer create-project --no-install contao/managed-edition <directory> <branch>
```

Replace `<directory>` with the directory you want to install the Managed
Edition in (use `.` for the current one). Replace `<branch>` with `4.x-dev` if
you want to add a new feature or with `<lts-version>.x-dev` (currently
`4.9.x-dev`) if you want to fix a bug.

Then adjust the `require` section in your `composer.json` file so Composer
loads the monorepo instead of the individual bundles:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.2",
    "contao/contao": "4.x-dev"
},
```

Again, use `4.x-dev` if you want to add a new feature or `<lts-version>.x-dev`
if you want to fix a bug.

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

Composer will automatically clone the Git repo into the `vendor/contao/contao`
folder. You can finish your setup by opening
`https://your-domain.local/contao/install` in your browser.

All the changes you make in `vendor/contao/contao` are tracked via Git, so
you can submit your pull request directly from within your application.

## Running scripts

First install the code quality tools:

```bash
composer bin all update
```

Then run the code quality scripts via Composer:

```bash
composer run all
composer run unit-tests
composer run cs-fixer
composer run phpstan
composer run psalm
```

If you want to pass additional flags to the underlying commands, you can use
the `--` argument:

```bash
composer run unit-tests -- --filter CoreBundle
composer run cs-fixer -- --clear-cache
```

## Functional tests

To set up functional tests, create a database named `contao_test` and import
the `core-bundle/tests/Functional/app/Resources/contao_test.sql` file.

```bash
mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE contao_test"
mysql contao_test < core-bundle/tests/Functional/app/Resources/contao_test.sql
```

If your database uses credentials, copy the file `core-bundle/phpunit.xml.dist`
to `core-bundle/phpunit.xml` and adjust the following line:

```xml
<php>
    <env name="DATABASE_URL" value="mysql://root@localhost:3306/contao_test" />
</php>
```

Then run the functional tests via the `run` command:

```bash
composer run functional-tests
```
